# Algorithm-Visualizers

Built 2 visualizers - one for Sorting Algorithms and the other for Pathfinding Algorithms


#### 1. Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer
Sorting Algorithm Visualiser created using Python and Pygame.

Algorithms implemented include Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Radix Sort.

Allows the user to visualize a randomly generated array and select a specified sorting algorithm to visualize the progression of the array being sorted and finally displays the sorted array.

### 2. Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualizer
**Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer** created using **Python, Pygame and Object Oriented Programming.**

Algorithms implemented include **A** and **Dijkstra's.**

**Description:**
Allows the user to select start and end points within the GUI, add barriers within the grid and select a specified search algorithm to visualize its progression from the start node to the end node and finally displays the shortest path.
